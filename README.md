# School_District_Analysis

##Project Overview

  ###The purpose of this project is listed below:
*  Deliverable 1: Collect the student data into a DataFrame.

* Deliverable 2: Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.

* Deliverable 3: Summarize key pieces of the data.

* Deliverable 4: Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.

* Deliverable 5: Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.

* Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results

**Summary
### Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results 
During the analysis, several important findings were made:

1. The average reading score for charter schools is higher compared to public schools.
2. The average math score for charter schools is also higher than that of public schools.
3. The total number of students varies significantly among schools, with Montgomery High School having the highest student count.
4. The average budget per grade is higher for public schools compared to charter schools.
5. Grade 12 students in charter schools have the lowest average math score among all grade levels and school types.

Additional analysis that could be worthwhile includes:

1. Investigating the relationship between school budget and student performance to determine if there is a correlation.
2. Comparing the average scores and budgets of schools in different districts or regions.
3. Analyzing the impact of school size on student performance and budget allocation.
4. Examining the distribution of scores within each school type to identify any variations or outliers.
5. Exploring other variables, such as student demographics or teacher qualifications, to understand their influence on student performance.

These additional analyses could provide further insights into the factors affecting student performance and help identify areas for improvement in the education system.
